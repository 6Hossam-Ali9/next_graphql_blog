This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Technologies Used

Nextjs, GraphQl and styles using Tailwind
Also, used "Lodash" library for throttling my API requests as hygraph has a very low number of requests just use it on each request in the dev mode, and "moment" library for formatting the dates

## Usage

This project is a blog app that can only be modified by me using hygraph, you can see the blogs move to any blog, you can go to a certain category and also in each blog you can see its categories and the related blogs.

## Deployment

You can have a look on the website from [here](https://next-graphql-blog-pi.vercel.app/) and also leave a comment so I can see it and publish it
